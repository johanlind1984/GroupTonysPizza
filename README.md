# GroupTonysPizza
School GroupProject

This program written as a school groupproject. The program is intended to simulate self-service desks in a fast food restaurant
with three terminals, one for the customers, one for the chef and one with the orderstatus of all the orders in the system.

The program consists of a tabview, each tab representing a terminal and a extra scene if "ändra" is pressed. Ändra simulates
the ability to make a custom make pizza where the user can add/remove ingredients to the pizza.

Make a clone of the repository and run the code in your IDE to try out the program.
